This is an introduction on how to use the command line and in the process you will be learning Linux too. 
As an engineer, I use the command line not only daily but hourly. It's a constant companion in terms of getting my work done and I wouldn't be nearly as effective as I am able to without a decent knowledge of how to use it.
I decided to create this workshop to empower new users of the command line to be able become instantly effective. 
While I maintain everything in this workshop is entry-level beginner friendly and useful knowledge, you will find even many senior engineers don't know how to do many of these things. 
The command line is an ocean of possibilities and often it's difficult to know what you don't know about it (so you can know to learn it.)
